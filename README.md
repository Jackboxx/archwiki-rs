## Installation
Currently, you can only install this tool from [ crates.io ](https://crates.io/crates/archwiki-rs) 
or build it from source. 

After you are finished with the installation you should run [update-all](#updating-everything).

### crates.io

```sh
cargo install archwiki-rs
```
### Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jackboxx/archwiki-rs
cd archwiki-rs
cargo build --release
cp ./target/release/archwiki-rs $SOME_DIRECTORY_IN_YOUR_PATH # e.g. $HOME/.cargo/bin
```

## Usage

### Reading Pages

```sh
archwiki-rs read-page Neovim
```

#### Using a different format
```sh
archwiki-rs read-page Neovim --format markdown
```

#### Caching

By default, pages are cached in the file system after they are fetched and subsequent
request for that page then use that cache. The cache is invalidated if the cache file hasn't 
been updated in the last 14 days.

#### 404 page not found (-Ì¥Ì¥Ì¥n-Ì¥Ì¥Ì¥ )

If the page you are searching for doesn't exist, a list of the pages that are most similar
(in name) to the page you asked for will be output instead of the page content. The
categories are stored locally and can be fetched with the [update-all](#updating-everything) 
command.

```sh
archwiki-rs read-page Neovi

# output
Neovim
...
```

Unlike the output when the page name does exist, this output is written to stderr instead
of stdout. If you want to, you can create a program that checks if no page was found and
uses stderr to give the user suggestions on what they might have wanted to type.


An example shell script to do something like this is available in the [repository](https://github.com/jackboxx/archwiki-rs)
under the name `example.sh`.

### Downloading page info

Page names are stored locally to prevent having to scrape the entire table of contents of
the ArchWiki with every command

#### Updating everything

```sh
archwiki-rs update-all
```

Be warned, since this scrapes multiple thousand links, this is very slow (-, - )â€¦zzzZZ

#### Updating a specific category

```sh
archwiki-rs update-category Xorg_commands
```

### Listing pages and categories

```sh
archwiki-rs list-pages
```

This is output a styled tree of categories and pages but if you need an easily parseable
list for a different program to use, you can use the `-f` flag to flatten the output into a
newline separated list that only contains the names of all pages

```sh
archwiki-rs list-pages -f
```

### File locations
All file paths use the the [directories](https://crates.io/crates/directories) crate

#### The page file

See [data_local_dir](https://docs.rs/directories/latest/directories/struct.BaseDirs.html#method.data_local_dir)
for more information.

#### Page cache files
See [cache_dir](https://docs.rs/directories/latest/directories/struct.BaseDirs.html#method.cache_dir)
for more information.
